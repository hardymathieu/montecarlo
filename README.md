A Monte Carlo simulation portfolio is a computational method used to estimate the potential outcomes of a portfolioâ€™s performance by generating a large number of random scenarios.
Quite helpful to understand where you might potentially end up given your chosen portfolio.

This uses
* Time-Weighted Returns (TWR): Calculation of TWR for each simulation allows for a fair comparison that neutralizes the effects of periodic cash inflows (deposits).
* Use of TWR in Plot: TWR is used as a measure to better reflect the performance of the portfolio under recurring investment conditions.

Doing this in colab.google.com works really well. No need to setup anything on your machine

A note: 
If you're looking at doing some planning, and you'd rather use something ready-made and much more complete, you can look this way: https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation?s=y&sl=6oLYsxBBfI5FP17w0KIRdX
But you'll likely better understand what you're doing if you try by yourself first, and ...it's more fun to DYI :)
